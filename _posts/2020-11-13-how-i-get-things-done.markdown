To be honest, I don't really like to rest in my free time, so I always try to look after some things to do: personal goals at work, home projects, contributions to open source libraries or voluntary organizations. 

After I realized this, I was able also to develop my custom-tailored workflows to keep these todos on track in a way that I never have to be bored because of the lack of projects or goals, or stressed about things I could forgot.

This post is about this workflow of mine. Probably there is nothing new in it, but I strongly believe that for each someone a slightly different approach works the best, and I think it may be useful to share mine.

## Different todo lists for different purposes
Each project has some kind of shared issue-board I can pick new tasks from. **I open these boards only when I really have time to focus on one single project**. (In work-related stuff this is easy, because I use these boards during working hours, but this is also true for my personal projects, more on that later.)

For the most important tasks I really don't want to forget I also create a reminder in my google calendar. My other not-so-urgent personal goals (which I don't really want to share with others yet) are tracked in a dedicated Google Keep note. I check these during idle times, for example on the bus. This routine helps me to keep my most important tasks in mind.

## The todo heartbeat
Well, actually this is just a fancy word for a very trivial stuff.

Probably you all experienced that some discussions are much more fluid if we dedicate some time for it (eg. we organize a meeting). I think this is also true for the personal tasks. Instead of constantly freaking out of forgetting tasks I regularly dedicate an hour for having a peaceful overview on all my tasks.

I'm really serious about these dedicated hours. I decline all other event offers and make sure that I can spend this time focused without any interruption.

## Summary
Well, this is how it is right now. Off course nothing is perfect, but still, these routines help me to do more in less time, among a decreased stress level.
